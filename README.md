Interview Test
===============

Consider the following task as the building block for an expanding project that could grow over the next few months.  You will own this project as a developer and it may grow to the point that other developers will be involved in its production.

The test is not about speed or memory performance.  It is simply to see how you lay out a project and your coding style. 

The task
=========

At the moment there are two file formats (tabbed and csv) that need to be mined.  There will be more to come in the future.  The field names are specified in the first row of each file.

Write a program to take the following request and produce the total sum of the field named "points".

The program will be invoked using: 
java application <FILE> <FORMAT>

where 

FILE is the filename
FORMAT - csv or tab

Two example datafiles are in the resourse folder within the eclipse project
